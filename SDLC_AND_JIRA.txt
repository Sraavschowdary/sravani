Phases of SDLC 

 1. Requirement Analysis
This is the phase where we listen.
* We talk to users, clients, or stakeholders.
* We understand their problems and expectations.
* We write down **what the software should do**.
Example:
A client says: “I want an app where users can log in and see their profile.”


 2. Planning 
This is the thinking and planning stage.
* Decide how much time, money, and people are needed.
* Identify risks and create a project schedule.
* Decide whether the project is possible or not.
Example:
“We need 3 developers, 1 tester, and 3 months to build this app.”


 3. Design 
This is where we draw the blueprint.
* Design screens, buttons, database, and system flow.
* Decide how different parts of the system talk to each other.
Example:
Designing the login screen, dashboard layout, and database tables.


 4. Development 
This is the coding phase.
* Developers write the actual code.
* Convert designs into a working application.
Example:
Writing code for login, registration, and user profile features.


 5. Testing 
This is where we check for mistakes.
* Test the software to find bugs or errors.
* Ensure it works as expected in different situations.
Example:
Testing valid login, invalid login, and empty fields.



6. Deployment
This is the release phase.
* The software is made live for real users.
* Installed on servers or published in app stores.
Example:
Launching the app so users can start logging in.



7. Maintenance 
This is the after-release care phase.
* Fix bugs found by users.
* Improve features and performance.
* Update the software when needed.
Example:
Fixing a login issue or adding a “Forgot Password” feature.



JIRA

1. User Story for Valid Login
Title: User can log in with valid credentials
Description:
As a registered user,
I want to log in to the application using my valid username and password,
So that I can access my account and use the application features.

2. User Story for Invalid Login
Title: User cannot log in with invalid credentials
Description:
As a user,
I want the system to prevent login with incorrect username or password,
So that my account remains secure and I am notified of invalid login attempts.

3. User Story for Mandatory Field Validation
Title: Login fields are mandatory
Description:
As a user,
I want the login form to validate mandatory fields,
So that I cannot submit the login form with empty username or password fields.
