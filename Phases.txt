Which feedback mechanism best connects the Operate and Plan phases to continuously refine reliability strategies across the DevOps lifecycle?
*
···
/2
A. Collecting incident reports but not systematically analyzing them
B. Annual reliability reviews that produce a static runbook for the next year
C. Tracking only infrastructure cost metrics and optimizing for the lowest spend
D. Maintaining a live error-budget dashboard integrated with planning tools, influencing prioritization of reliability work vs. new features
 
No correct answers
 
In the Operate phase, which practice best demonstrates a DevOps mindset focused on reliability and shared ownership?
*
2/2
A. Keeping operations responsibilities isolated to a dedicated ops team
B. Relying solely on reactive incident handling without defined service-level objectives
C. Implementing Site Reliability Engineering practices with shared on-call rotations
 
D. Allowing developers to deploy but forbidding them from accessing production metrics
 
In the Deploy phase, how can a DevOps team best ensure that infrastructure changes are consistent, auditable, and repeatable across environments?
*
1/1
A. Applying configuration changes manually on each server as needed
B. Relying on operations staff to remember deployment steps from documentation
C. Using infrastructure as code with version control, automated validation, and immutable artifacts
 
D. Cloning production servers manually to create new environments when required
 
How does the continuous feedback loop between Monitor and Plan phases help refine the DevOps lifecycle over time?
*
1/1
A. By feeding production insights into planning to reprioritize work, improve reliability, and refine assumptions
 
B. By using monitoring data solely to prove that service-level objectives are always met
C. By using monitoring only to identify which team member caused an incident
D. By treating monitoring results as operational noise separate from product decisions
 
During the Code phase, which strategy most effectively prepares artifacts for later high-frequency, low-risk deployments in the Release and Deploy phases?
*
1/1
A. Deferring non-functional requirements like performance and security to a hardening sprint
B. Embedding feature flags and trunk-based development with strict automated quality gates
 
C. Requiring manual exploratory testing as the primary quality control measure
D. Mandating long-lived feature branches that are merged only before major releases
 
A team wants to better connect the Plan, Code, and Operate phases by defining meaningful metrics.   Which set of metrics best supports a holistic DevOps lifecycle?
*
1/1
A. Focusing solely on hardware utilization and infrastructure cost metrics
B. Only tracking lines of code written and number of commits per developer
C. Measuring only the number of features delivered per quarter
D. Using a combination of flow metrics (like deployment frequency), reliability metrics (like error rates), and customer-centric metrics (like task success)
 
 
During the Test phase, which approach best supports continuous, production-like validation that directly informs the Deploy and Operate phases?
*
2/2
A. Running nightly end-to-end tests against a shared staging environment that loosely resembles production
B. Using contract tests only at the service boundary and ignoring cross-service workflows
C. Implementing environment-agnostic, declarative test suites plus synthetic and chaos tests executed automatically in pre-production and selectively in production
 
D. Relying solely on unit tests with very high code coverage
 
During the Code, Build, and Test phases, a team notices that deployment frequency is high but change failure rate is also increasing. Which adjustment across the DevOps lifecycle is most appropriate?
*
1/1
A. Removing automated tests that take longer than a few seconds to speed up the pipeline
B. Slowing down deployments indefinitely to reduce risk
C. Adding targeted automated tests and improving observability around high-risk areas before release
 
D. Delegating all deployment decisions to a central change advisory board
 
Which practice most effectively closes the loop between Monitor and Test phases to prevent regression of resolved incidents?
*
2/2
A. Automatically generating or updating regression tests from incident postmortems and linking them to monitoring alerts
 
B. Logging incidents in a ticketing system without further action
C. Running only synthetic uptime checks without validating business flows
D. Relying on tribal knowledge so engineers remember to add tests after major outages
 
In the Build phase, a DevOps team is experiencing inconsistent builds across developer machines and the CI server. Which strategy best addresses this issue in a mature DevOps lifecycle?
*
1/1
A. Allowing each microservice team to choose its own unique build tools with no constraints
B. Running builds only on the CI server and never locally to avoid discrepancies
C. Relying on developers to manually configure their environments to match the CI server
D. Using containerized build environments defined as code and reused across all stages
 
 
In the Code phase, a team wants to reduce integration issues and improve collaboration across multiple microservices. Which practice most strongly supports a DevOps-first approach to coding?

A.     

*
1/1
Adopting trunk-based development with frequent small merges and automated checks
 
Separating ops-related code into a different repository to avoid coupling
Mandating that all developers commit directly to the main branch without any checks
Maintaining long-lived feature branches that are merged only at the end of a release cycle
 
During the Release phase, a team wants to minimize risk while deploying frequently. Which release strategy best aligns with advanced DevOps practices?
*
2/2
A. Using blue-green or canary releases combined with feature flags
 
B. Performing big-bang releases with many features bundled together
C. Allowing teams to deploy directly to production without any release governance
D. Freezing the production environment for long periods before each release
 
During the Plan phase of the DevOps lifecycle, a team is deciding on work items for an upcoming quarter. Which practice best aligns with a high-maturity DevOps approach to planning?

*
1/1
Using a dynamic, prioritized product backlog with frequent feedback-driven refinement
 
Locking down a fixed scope for the whole quarter and disallowing changes
Creating a detailed Gantt chart with all dependencies fixed upfront
Letting each developer choose tasks independently without shared prioritization
 
In the Monitor phase, which approach most effectively supports continuous improvement across the DevOps lifecycle?
*
1/1
A. Implementing centralized observability with metrics, logs, and traces tied to business outcomes
 
B. Monitoring solely infrastructure metrics without including user experience signals
C. Relying on basic server uptime checks without application-level monitoring
D. Collecting logs and metrics only when a major incident occurs
 
In the Test phase, what is the most DevOps-aligned way to ensure that tests effectively protect production reliability without blocking fast delivery?
*
1/1
A. Postponing most testing to the staging environment to keep earlier stages fast
B. Running a large, manual regression test only before major releases
C. Automating a layered test strategy with fast checks early and targeted slower tests later in the pipeline
 
D. Relying solely on unit tests and skipping integration and end-to-end tests
